# Iris Flower dataset exercise

I used the classic Iris flower dataset for my first 
machine learning project. My goal was to get accustumed
to using the python data science libraries:
- **Pandas** 
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**

as well as:
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models

I implemented:
- PCA visualisation of the iris dataset
- Splitting data into training and testing sections
- Logistic regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors classifier
- Visualisation of confusion matrices with Seaborn heatmaps
